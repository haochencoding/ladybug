# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for a smart watch app - ladybug (version 2) on Bangle.js2. The app is improved based on the original ladybug app (i.e., ladybugv1.app.js), built by [rajeevmsn](https://github.com/rajeevmsn). 

This version turns the original app into a widget, so it can collect heart rate and movement data in the background. This improvement allows users to run other apps while doing data collection. 

# How to use 
Upload following files to Bangle.js:
- ladybug.app.js
- ladybug.dataRecorder.js
- ladybug.img
- ladybug.info
- ladybug.settings.json
- ladybug.wid.js

Load the ladybug app on the app laucher.
